## Data Wrangling & Brief Summary
The original dataset comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries).

```{r, message =FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  #set_up
library(patchwork) 
df <- read.csv("Levels_Fyi_Salary_Data.csv")
```

```{r}
df1 <- df %>% # data wrangling 
  select(title, yearsofexperience, totalyearlycompensation) %>%
  filter( title == "Business Analyst" | title == "Management Consultant")
df2 <- df %>% # data wrangling 
  select(title, yearsofexperience, totalyearlycompensation, company) %>%
  filter( company == "Amazon" | company == "Google" | company == "Microsoft" | company == "Apple" | company == "Facebook")

summary(df1)
summary(df2)
```

## Visualizing Relationships
* Note the relationship between years of experience and salaries is expressed in both following visualizations.

### For major companies, such as *Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft*: 
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot( df2, aes( x =yearsofexperience, y = totalyearlycompensation, color = company)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth( method = lm, formula = y~x, se = FALSE) + 
  labs( x = "Years of Experience", y = "Yearly Compensation", title = "Years of Experience Vs. Yearly Compensation for Major Companies")
```



### For specific job titles, such as *Business Analyst & Management Consultant*:
```{r}
ggplot( df1, aes( x =yearsofexperience, y = totalyearlycompensation, color = title)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth( method = lm, formula = y~x, se = FALSE) + 
  labs( x = "Years of Experience", y = "Yearly Compensation", title = "Years of Experience Vs. Yearly Compensation for BA & MC")
```
